      <p>
        On this page I've collected the melodies of a handful of old nursery
        rhymes, specifically some of those featured in Ladybird's square nursery
        rhyme books from 1987:
        <ul>
          <li>My book of animal rhymes</li>
          <li>My book of playtime rhymes</li>
          <li>My book of bedtime rhymes</li>
          <li>My book of nursery rhymes</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each melody is shown as sheet music (svg), with a playable audio version
        (midi), the
        rhyme's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_folk_songs_by_Roud_number">Roud
        number</a> and a link to the source where I found the tune.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact wording and tunes of nursery rhymes varies a lot according to
        region, culture and time period.  I've usually tried to use the most
        common tune, but where I'm not sure I just picked my favourite.  In some
        cases I tweaked the melody a bit to match the wording in the Ladybird
        books.

        I transcribed the scores in MuseScore 2 and produced this website using
        a rudimentary bash script. All the source code and scores
        are <a href="https://github.com/mtorpey/nursery-rhymes">here</a>. There's
        also an A5 pdf version <a href="nursery-rhymes.pdf">here</a>, and a book
        version suitable for short-edge-flip double-sided
        printing <a href="nursery-rhymes-book.pdf">here</a>.
